# Time-Series-Forecasting
Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices of HCL Technologies using Auto-ARIMA modeling. The goal was to build an optimized and efficient time series forecasting pipeline capable of generating accurate short-term predictions.

 Key Highlights

Auto-ARIMA Optimization: Reduced model selection time by 70% through automated hyperparameter tuning.

Data Coverage: Processed 2,500+ daily stock records spanning multiple years.

Modeling: Developed a 30-day price forecast using the optimized ARIMA (3,1,2) model.

Validation: Verified time series assumptions using the Dickey-Fuller stationarity test.

Tech Stack

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, pmdarima (Auto-ARIMA), Matplotlib

Techniques: Time Series Forecasting, Auto-ARIMA, Stationarity Testing, Residual Diagnostics

Results

Achieved robust short-term forecasts with strong statistical validation.

Streamlined the model selection process for real-world financial time series applications.
